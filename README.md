# College-finder

## Problem Statement
Create a web-based portal where students can enter the GRE score, CGPA and other parameters and can get a list of universities where the probability of admission for a Masters Degree is high.

## Implementation
A simple classification based Machine Learning model was built and trained on a dataset. The students are required to login, and register if their account has not been created. During registration, their scores are taken and stored.

### Login

### Registration

On logging in, they are redirected to the college list page where the probable list of colleges is displayed. The prediction is based on the scores entered and is customised for different users.

### Prediction

The users are also given the option to filter colleges on the basis of their budget and/or location.

### Filtering on budget basis

Apart from this, if a student appears for an exam again or their score changes, they can update their scores and a fresh list of colleges is predicted on the new score's basis.
